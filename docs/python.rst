Python
======
Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate 
your systems more effectively. [1]

Why Python
----------
1. Easy to learn and be productive. 
	- Compact language with very good design.
2. Produce beutiful code by enforcing indentation. 
	- Clean code makes maintenance and debugging easier and less annoying. Simple syntax.
4. Less is more. 
	- Write less code to achieve more functionality. There is usually one good way of doing something.
4. General-purpose language. 
	- Can be used for Web development, Desktop (GUI), mobile development, Scientific calculations and as a scripting language.
5. New kid on the block.
	- All the cool kids are using it, Eg Google, NASA, Yahoo, Instagram. [2]
	
6. Dynamically type language.
	- Use variables on the fly without declaring first
	
Why not Python
--------------
1. Enforced indentation can be annoying 
2. Not support by common hosting platforms
3. Interpreted language. This may be slower than compiled languages
4. Dynamically typed language. 
	- Can make execution slower especially on devices with limited processing.  Eg: Mobile 
	- Runtime errors for undeclared variables
