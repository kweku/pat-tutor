Editor: Windows
===============

On Windows, we suggest the Notepad++ text editor. It is actually
unrelated to the Windows default program called Notepad.

To install it:

-  Click and download
   http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/6.4.5/npp.6.4.5.Installer.exe
-  Run the installer, and follow the process to the end.

To run it:

-  In Windows Vista or Windows 7, click on the Start menu, type
   *Notepad++* in the Search Field, and hit enter.
-  In Windows XP, click on the Start menu, navigate to All Programs, and
   then navigate to Notepad++.

Configure Notepad++ to indent with spaces
-----------------------------------------

-  Click Settings -> Preferences
-  Find the tab labeled "Language Menu/Tab Settings"
-  Find the box labeled "Replace by space", and make sure it is
   **checked**
-  Click Close.

That's it! Now, you can hit tab to indent your code, and that
indentation will actually be made of spaces. This change will help you
use spaces consistently, so that Python doesn't get confused about
whitespace.

Success!
--------

Now you have an editor that you can use to open any text file, including
Python programs.
