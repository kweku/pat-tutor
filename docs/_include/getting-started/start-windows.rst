Start: Windows
==============

#. Open a command prompt:
   \* On Windows Vista or Windows 7: click on the Start menu (the
   Windows logo in the lower left of the screen), type ``cmd`` into the
   Search field directly above the Start menu button, and click on "cmd"
   in the search results above the Search field.

   -  On Windows XP: click on the Start menu (the Windows logo in the
      lower left of the screen), click on "Run...", type ``cmd`` into
      the text box, and hit enter. 

   To start Python, type

   ::

       python

   at the command prompt and hit enter. You should see something like

   ::

       Python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, ...) on win32
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>>

   The ``>>>`` indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

#. Exit the Python prompt by typing
   ::

       exit()

   and hitting enter. Now you're back at the Windows command prompt
   (``C:\``).

Success!
~~~~~~~~

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command
prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
