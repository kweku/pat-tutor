Start: Linux
============

Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make
sure you can start a terminal and run Python from the command line.

#. Open a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal application
   at Applications/Accessories/Terminal, or it may already be on your
   menu bar.
#. To start Python, type
   ::

       python

   at the comand prompt and hit enter. You should see something like

   ::

       Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
       [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>> 

   The ``>>>`` indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

#. Exit the Python prompt by typing
   ::

       exit()

   and hitting enter. Now you're back at the Linux command prompt (which
   looks something like ``jesstess$``).

Success!
--------

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command
prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
