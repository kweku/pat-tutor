Setup: Linux
==============

Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make
sure you can start a terminal and run Python from the command line.

#. Start up a Terminal. You can find the Terminal application at
   ``Applications/Accessories/Terminal``, or it may already be on your
   menu bar.
   This Terminal contains something called a command prompt. This
   command prompt is another way of navigating your computer and running
   programs -- just textually instead of graphically. We are going to be
   running Python and Python scripts from this command prompt.
#. Test your Python install at the command prompt. Type
   ::

       python

   and hit enter. You should see something like

   ::

       Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
       [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>> 

-  You just started Python! The ``>>>`` indicates that you are at a new
   type of prompt: a Python prompt. The command prompt let's you
   navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt lets
   you write and run Python code interactively.

-  If the Python version number (2.7.1 in the example above) is not a
   number between 2.4 and 2.7 (ignoring the number after the second
   dot), tell a staff member. 

To exit the Python prompt, type

::

    exit()

and press Enter. This will take you back to the Linux command prompt. 

You might need to install a package called python-tk.

Success!
