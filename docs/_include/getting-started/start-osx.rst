Start: OSX
===========

#. Start up a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal
   application through Spotlight, or navigate to
   Applications/Utilities/Terminal.
#. To start Python, type
   ::

       python

   at the command prompt and hit enter. You should see something like

   ::

       Python 2.7.1 (r261:67515, Feb 11 2010, 00:51:29) 
       [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>>

   The ``>>>`` indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

#. Exit the Python prompt by typing
   ::

       exit()

   and hitting enter. Now you're back at the OS X command prompt (which
   looks something like ``jesstess$``).

Success!
--------

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command
prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
