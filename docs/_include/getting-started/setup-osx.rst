Setup: OSX
============

OS X ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make
sure you can start a Terminal and run Python from the command line.

#. Start up a Terminal. You can find the Terminal application through
   Spotlight, or navigate to Applications/Utilities/Terminal.
   This Terminal contains something called a command prompt. This
   command prompt is another way of navigating your computer and running
   programs -- just textually instead of graphically. We are going to be
   running Python and Python scripts from this command prompt.
#. Test your Python install at the command prompt. Type
   ::

       python

   and hit enter. You should see something like

   ::

       Python 2.7.1 (r261:67515, Feb 11 2010, 00:51:29) 
       [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>>

   -  You just started Python! The ``>>>`` indicates that you are at a
      new type of prompt -- a Python prompt. The command prompt let's
      you navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt
      lets you write and run Python code interactively.

   -  If the Python version number (2.7.1 in the example above) is not a
      number between 2.4 and 2.7 (ignoring the number after the second
      dot), tell a staff member.

#. To exit the Python prompt, type
   ::

       exit()

   and press Enter. This will take you back to the OS X command prompt.

Success!
